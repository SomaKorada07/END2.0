## Training

1. Input, Target and Weights are initialized.

2. Hidden neuron values and activated neuron values are calculated based on forward pass.

3. Error is computed by calculating the difference between activated output neurons and actual target values.

4. Gradients are computed using the backward pass for each weight.

5. Weights are corrected using the gradient and Learning Rate values.

6. This process is repeated until the error is as minimum as possible.
